TO GET TO THE SCREEN TO SEE THE PROJECT, ADD /assign1 TO END OF URL

# assignmentP1
Designed for a coding assignment, specifically to a case study.
The pages are totally static as well

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
- further formatting because you can never have enough (dw i (emily) will do this over time)
- other job descriptions to be added upon
- animations and enhancements to be added (we need at least 1, best if we get 2 good ones and as many minor ones as possible)
- some simple drawings should be added onto each page (drawings like the header photo) (OPTIONAL)
- perhaps we add extra pages on products our website provides (OPTIONAL)
- enhancement documentation should be added
...

RECENT UPDATES:
- addition of header
- addition of logo (also links to homepage upon click)
- change to navbar buttons (now they are the same size)
- navbar has become 'sticky' and thus will always be at the top of your screen
- footer has been added with some basic information (has potential for improvement if I make a container/table to format it better)
- footer has been fixed to the bottom of the page, not the screen
- background has been improved upon (html is blue, content is white) this will allow for animations on the content to be potentially made (like fade in etc)
- content div has been added so header, footer and body can be isolated
- hover effect applied to about table
- margins ensure no whitespace anywhere
- each page has been installed with the basic fundamental divs and necessary articles/sections
- job description no.1 has been implemented
- basic additions have been made to form page
- basic additions have been made to index
- super basic additions made to enhancements page
- addition of extra stuff on about page (REQUIRES NEXT MEET UP FOR ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT TO BE DECIDED
- some spelling mistakes have been fixed up (haha i suck at spelling)
...

ERRORS NOTICED:
- there is a slight gap between the heading photo and the navbar which i am struggling to remove
- heading photo is stretched (easy fix)
- logo text is badly done haha
...



PLEASE ADD TO ERRORS/RECENT UPDATES IF ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT IS FOUND/DONE
