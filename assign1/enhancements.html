                <h1>Mobile view adjustment</h1>
                <p>We have created a responsive navbar, which means that for screen sizes greater than or equal to 1460 pixels, the navbar
                elements will be compressed into a single container. This container will be displayed whenever a user clicks on the
                hamburger icon, and it will open on the right side like a navigation drawer.

                Additionally, we have made adjustments to the content by providing margin, padding, and transition properties that are
                relative to the screen dimensions on mobile devices</p>

            <!--BELOW ENTER SECOND ENHANCEMENT APPLIED AND THEN A DESCRIPTION OF THE ENHANCEMENT-->
            <article class="enhancementDescription">
                <h1>Animations on Navbar and Submission Button</h1>
                <p>We have added hover effects to the navbar menu elements and submission button, which improve user engagement and enhance
                overall user experience. These effects can visually communicate to users that an element is clickable, such as a button
                or link. When a user hovers over the element, it will change color or have some other visual effect that signals its
                interactive nature.</p>

            <article class="enhancementDescription">
                    <h1>Accessibility Adjustments</h1>
                    <p> Making changes to titles and alt tags on a website can help people with disabilities by making it easier for them to use screen readers and navigate the site. It can also help people with poor eyesight and improve the site's visibility on search engines. By providing descriptive and accurate information, we have make sure that everyone can understand and use the site. By following these practices, it is  more accessible to all users.</p>
